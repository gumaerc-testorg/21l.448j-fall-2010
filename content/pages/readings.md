The materials in this course offer a mixture of discursive and narrative texts dealing with a variety of evolutionary issues. In this class, we read what many thinkers and writers have had to say about one of the great human questions: how the realm we call nature defines our existence. Your reading and discussion of authors who have considered this question will help provide you with a historical foundation for understanding a rich literary tradition, as well as many assumptions held by people in many contemporary cultures. There will be about 100 pages of weekly readings – sometimes less, sometimes more.

### Some reading topics for Malthus's An Essay on the Principle of Population

*\[Read chapters 1–3, chapter 9.\]*

1\. *To what extent, if any, do you think Malthus's concept of the Natural Inequality holds in an age of advanced technology? Does technology have the potential to eliminate the Malthusian predicament*?

2\. *According to Adam Smith, self–interest drives the development of an economy that benefits everyone by providing more opportunity. This self–interest could be argued to be instinctual, un–self–conscious behavior. In Malthus's system, instinct, which may lead to the development of an economy, leads also to the production of excess population. Can the views of Smith and Malthus be reconciled*?

3\. *Malthus introduces the term Struggle for Existence in Chapter 3. How does this term apply to his system? Is it used in any way that suggests evolutionary process*?

### Some reading topics for Malthus's Essay on the Principle of Population

*\[Read chapters 13, 14, 18–19\]*

1\. *Malthus seems to view the human mind as a compound entity. Compare the role of instinct in Malthus's Essay and Smith's Wealth? What does the compound nature of the mind in the Essay have to do with Malthus's rejection of Smith's view of human motivation*?

2\. *In Chapter 18, Malthus suggests that the human mind arises out of the misery of the human condition. Do you agree? Why*?

### Some reading topics

1\. *Huxley speaks of the State of Nature (Section 1, pp. 1–5)) and the Human State of Art (Section 2, pp. 9–11), and the two in a state of conflict with each other (Section 3, pp. 11–3). Is this a valid way of thinking about the human relationship with its conditions of existence*?

2\. *What are some of the implications of Huxley's analogy of human culture and the colony (Section 5, pp. 16–7)*.

3\. *On p. 20, Huxley states that humans compete in evolutionary terms not by struggling with each other but by controlling their conditions of existence. What are the implications of this human strategy?*

4\. *In Section 7 (pp. 20–1), Huxley identifies the serpent in the human Garden of Eden. What is the serpent and how integral a part of human existence is this force*?

5\. *In Section 10 (pp. 26–30), Huxley expands on the human condition as one in which humans carry within themselves the seeds of their own destruction. Does this view share anything with the view of Voltaire in Candide? How is Huxley's view different from that of Voltaire?*

1\. *Compare the dystopian visions of Wells and Butler. Both use evolutionary themes, but in very different ways.*

2\. *Could human society regress in the way that Wells suggests in his characterization of the Eloi and Morlocks?*

3\. *Are Wells's creatures reminiscent of Stevenson's Jekyll and Hyde in any way?*

4\. *Does Wells's novel reflect any of the problems of Huxley's Evolution and Ethics?*
